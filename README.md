# SHDBotProject
This project is a 1-week project to experiment with the Discord JDA bot and
learn how to connect a simple application so a database.  I will be using
a local MySQL database to format.  Object-Oriented design will help make the
project look more organized.

My goal with this project is to learn more about what sort of things you would need
when you publish a project or an application to the public.  I want to make something usable
so that users can use a functioning product.  Some parts of this project after a week
will be tested and bug tested to see what could have been better and what was
done really well.

#Currency System
The database of this application will connect a certain user id on Discord to
the amount of coins that they have.  Every time a user sends a message into the
Discord server, the user will gain one coin (the amount of coins that you get
per minute is limited).  Some implemented games can be played to earn more
coins.

**!litcoin**: A command that will get the amount of currency that the user has.

**!currency-help**: A description of how the currency works is sent into chat.

#Game System
As mentioned previously, this bot will have a game system.  Here are the games
that can be played.

**!flipcoin**: Will simply flip a coin where a user can wager a certain amount of money

**!bankheist**: A classic bankheist game that lets users wager currency.  Users may win
or lose money depending on the outcome of the heist.

**!challenge**: Challenge a player to a basic reaction time duel.  First person to type
in the duel command wins.  No money is wagered, but you get bragging rights!

**!trivia**: Answer some trivia questions!

#Other Commands

**!help**: Pulls up a list of commands.

**!git**: Sends the link to the github repo.

**!quote**:  Lets the user add a quote to the database.

**!userInfo**: Posts the users info in the chat.
